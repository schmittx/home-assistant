Remove `mode: yaml` from `lovelace:` in your `configuration.yaml`\n2. If you have `resources:` declared in your lovelace configuration, add `resource_mode: yaml` to keep loading resources from YAML\n3. Add a dashboard entry in your `configuration.yaml`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   lovelace:\n     resource_mode: yaml  # Add this if you have resources declared\n     dashboards:\n       lovelace:\n         mode: yaml\n         filename: {config_file}\n         title: Overview\n         icon: mdi:view-dashboard\n         show_in_sidebar: true\n   ```\n\n4.
